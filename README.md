    Dear DevHaxx Users,
</p>

<p align="center">
    We regret to inform you that we are discontinuing the DevHaxx project and we want to provide you with some insights into this conclusion.
</p>

<p align="center">
    DevHaxx was initially created for educational purposes, with the intention of exploring and understanding the inner workings of the i-Ready platform. The aim was to provide Curriculum Associates useful tips on how to improve the "i-Ready" platform's security.
</p>

<p align="center">
    We want to emphasize that DevHaxx was never intended for malicious purposes. Our primary goal was to promote educational exploration and responsible use of technology. We appreciate the support and engagement from the community during the project's lifespan.
</p>

<p align="center">
    As we move forward, we encourage users to respect the decision to discontinue the project and refrain from any further use or distribution of DevHaxx. We remain committed to fostering a positive and ethical use of technology.
</p>

<p align="center">
    Sincerely, The DevTech Team.
