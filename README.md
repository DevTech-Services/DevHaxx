DevHaxx is permanently discontinued. To hear why, read the message down below;
<p align="center">
To whom it may concern,
<p align="center">
We, the DevHaxx  developers would want to clarify that we do not approve of or promote the use of their exploit to rig or falsify iReady tests. Our exploit was created solely as a proof of concept to highlight possible weaknesses in the iReady system and for educational reasons.
<p align="center">
We apologize for any harm that may have been caused and accept that our actions may have unintended repercussions. We never intended to compromise the fairness of educational evaluations or to give any student or group of students an unfair advantage.
<p align="center">
As a result, we formally condemn and strongly discourage using the DevHaxx exploit in any way. We hope that both instructors and students would decide to achieve academic greatness by working hard and honestly, without turning to unfair or unethical tactics of gaining an advantage.
<p align="center">
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
<p align="center">
This will also no longer be updated.

Sincerely, The DevTech Team. <br>
